**Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name],**

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the [Job Title] position at [Company Name], which I discovered on [Platform where you saw the ad, e.g., LinkedIn]. With my hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, penetration testing, and defensive security monitoring, I am confident that I possess the practical skills necessary to excel in this role.

During a recent self-directed 30-day capstone project, I designed and executed an end-to-end security lab to simulate real-world challenges. Key accomplishments from this project that align with your requirements include:

* **Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD**: I used Terraform to build a cloud environment and integrated GitHub Actions to create CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, demonstrating a strong foundation in modern DevOps practices.
* **Offensive & Defensive Operations**: I performed a penetration test on a web application, where I discovered and remediated a critical SQL injection vulnerability. I then configured a Splunk SIEM to ingest logs from the application and successfully built a real-time alert to detect the attack signature.

A full, detailed summary of this project, including my penetration test report and architecture diagrams, is available in my public portfolio for your review. I am eager to bring this proactive and hands-on approach to security to the team at [Company Name].

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,
[Reza Aramjou]
